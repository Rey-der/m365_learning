# Microsoft 365 Learning & Operations Lab

**Hands-on learning. Operational thinking. Enterprise mindset.**

</div>

---

## Purpose

This repository documents my **hands-on journey into Microsoft 365 operations** with a clear goal:

> **Become production-ready as a Junior Microsoft 365 Engineer.**

No theory-only notes.  
No certificate dumping.  
This repo focuses on **realistic tenant scenarios, security decisions, automation and incident handling**.

---

## What this repository represents

-  **Tenant-first thinking** instead of feature-clicking  
-  **Identity & security as core principles**  
-  **Automation where it makes sense**  
-  **Troubleshooting over tutorials**  
-  **Clear documentation and decision rationale**

This is not a demo project.  
This is a **simulated operational environment**.
